Todo
----------

* coding: WebStorm IDE; useCoffeeScript and SASS (while we're trying new things anyway)
* server-side: node.js - http://www.toptal.com/nodejs/why-the-hell-would-i-use-node-js
* client-side: peer.js - http://peerjs.com/ & bootstrap
* SSL: https://www.startssl.com/?app=1
* people can start rooms which are accessible by URL (like etherpad), which can have a maximum history time
* websites can embed the chat functionality in one of two ways
  - simply create an iframe with the chat - username can be passed through URL but is not protected, and the room is generally accessible
  - create a namespace with a (secret) key; rooms in that namespace need authentication, provided by URL /namespace/room?user=name&key=K3Y, where K3Y is hash of current hour, username, room and key
  - (there is another iframe which shows stats like new messages)


Misc
----------
* cooking for one session
* secure connection (but p2p can't be secure?)
* do bootstrap fonts work?
